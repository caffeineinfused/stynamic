These are some files that I have been messing around with to make sure the wrappers are functioning as expected.

Client.c is just some old file from a few years ago.

I have created ValTest.c specifically for testing out the Memcheck function with Valgrind.

Run makefile to make executable

If done that way when running file ValgWrapper.py the main file will look for this file and run the analysis.
