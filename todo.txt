To-Do
	note delineation between our work/code and flawfinder/valgrind/clang/etc
	Stynamic
		flags
			-f file list (can be taken multiple times) (ff)
			-m makefile (exclusive from -b and -g) (vg)
			-a auto file (exclusive from -f, propose file list automatically) (ff)
			-v verbose (lots of output)
			-q quick (little output, no false positives)
			-b binary (vg)
		touch up/productize
			make sure all the arguments are used or remove them if not
			make sure different verbosities work
			implement the "auto file" function
			implement the makefile option (or remove flag)
			make sure useful error messages are displayed when bad arg options are provided
		xml
			make valgwrapper ask for XML output and return that to stynamic in a useful way
		test
			run unit tests on different source to verify parsing always works
		side by side line attribution
			get output from flawfinder and valgrind and show it side by side, allowing users of Stynamic to scroll the errors those find while having them attributed by line
			to do this, add the 'xml=yes' arg when running valgrind, and add 'xml-fd=N' where N is the file descriptor (e.g., 1 for stdout)
