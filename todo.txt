To-Do
	note delineation between our work/code and flawfinder/valgrind/clang/etc
	Stynamic
		flags
			-f file list (can be taken multiple times) (ff)
			-a auto file (can be used in addition to -f, propose file list automatically) (ff)
			-v verbose (lots of output)
			-q quick (little output, no false positives)
			-d default
			-b binary (vg)
			-ba binary args (vg)
		touch up/productize
			make sure all the arguments are used or remove them if not
			make sure different verbosities work
			make sure useful error messages are displayed when bad arg options are provided
			comment out any "debug" code that we used to help us trace issues
			finalize code commenting
		test
			run unit tests on different source to verify parsing always works
		side by side line attribution
			get output from flawfinder and valgrind and show it side by side, allowing users of Stynamic to scroll the errors those find while having them attributed by line
			to do this, add the 'xml=yes' arg when running valgrind, and add 'xml-fd=N' where N is the file descriptor (e.g., 1 for stdout)
